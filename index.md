[PLTea](https://pltea.github.io/) is an initiative to bring together the members of the PL Community (virtually of course!) for informal discussions on all things life. This is the place where you talk about that new hobby you picked up, or that new cool programming language you designed, or that amazing paper you wrote.

The logistics are simple. You express your interest by filling a Google Form. We share a Zoom link for the meeting via email. All participants are randomly assigned to breakout rooms. The rooms are shuffled every fifteen to twenty minutes. Virtual roommates introduce themselves and engage in free-form discussions.
